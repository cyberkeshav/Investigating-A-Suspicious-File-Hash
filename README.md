<h1>Investigating A Suspicious File Hash Using Virus Total</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, I was asked to review the following scenario and analyze an artifact using VirusTotal so as to capture details about its related indicators of compromise using the Pyramid of Pain:

You are a level one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. You have received an alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. 

You investigate this alert and discover that the employee received an email containing an attachment. The attachment was a password-protected spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet's password was provided in the email. The employee downloaded the file, then entered the password to open the file. When the employee opened the file, a malicious payload was then executed on their computer. 

You retrieve the malicious file and create a SHA256 hash of the file. SHA256 file hash is 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b. You might recall from a previous course that a hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can't be decrypted. Hashing is a cryptographic method used to uniquely identify malware, acting as the file's unique fingerprint. 

Now that you have the file hash, you will use VirusTotal to uncover additional IoCs that are associated with the file.

Be sure to include the following points in the template of your completed activity: 
- A statement explaining whether the file hash is malicious
- Three different types of indicators of compromise
